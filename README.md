# Linear-Search
Linear Search in Python
<pre><p>
  A search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then 
  that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.
  
  Example:
  array = [18, 5, 13, 9, 12, 22, 7, 16]
  index =  0   1   2  3   4   5  6   7
  
  Explanation: Array indexing starts from zero, so the code returns the index based on array indexing. 
               To get the actual position of the element in the array, just add 1 in the index returned by the code.
